My name is Adam DeDobbelaere (pronounced dee-dah-bil-air). I'm a Ph.D. student in philosophy at the University of Rochester. Most of my research is in metaphysics, especially material composition, paradoxes, and time. I'm also interested in bioethics, especially artificial intelligence in patient care and algorithmic fairness. Below you can find my recent blog posts, and on the sidebar you can find links to all the information about myself I'm willing to publish on the web. Thanks for stopping by!
