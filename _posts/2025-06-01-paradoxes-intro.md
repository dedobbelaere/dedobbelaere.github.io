title: How to Resolve Paradoxes
---

***

*In today's blog I'm experimenting with doing some public philosophy. I'll be giving a brief introduction into one of my favorite topics in philosophy: paradoxes. In doing so, I'll cover a basic framework for dealing with paradoxes, apply that framework to an instance of a Benardete paradox, and explain how paradoxes have broader philosophical importance than just being fun puzzles.*

Suppose you're about to kick a ball into a soccer goal. Directly in front of the goal, there is a wall, which we'll call $W_1$. Halfway between midfield and $W_1$ is a second wall, 
$W_2$. Halfway between midfield and $W_2$ is a third wall, $W_3$, and so on *ad infinitum*. Thus for any wall $W_n$, there is a wall $W_{n+1}$, which is halfway between $W_n$ and midfield. Note that this means there are countably infinite walls between the goal and midfield, which get closer and closer together as $n$ increases.

It should be clear that if there are infinite walls between you and the goal, the ball is not going to go into the goal. But which wall is going to stop the ball? $W_1$ can't stop the ball, because $W_2$ would stop the ball before it could reach $W_1$. Similarly, $W_2$ can't stop the ball because $W_3$ would stop the ball before it could reach $W_2$. This reasoning generalizes to the broader claim that **no** wall $W_n$ can stop the ball, because $W_{n+1}$ would stop the ball before it could reach $W_n$. But if none of the walls stop the ball, then the ball must go into the goal. But the ball can't go into the goal, since there are infinite walls between you and the goal. But none of the walls...and so on and so forth.

This is one form of a Benardete paradox, named after Syracuse philosophy professor Jose Benardete. The general form of this sort of paradox comes from Benardete's 1964 book *Infinity: An Essay In Metaphysics*. The version I've given here originates (as far as I have been able to tell) from Bruno Whittle, one of my undergraduate professors at the University of Wisconsin.

Naming the paradox is a start, but how do we solve it? There's no trick to this question as there would be in a riddle or a brain teaser. The walls are solid and immovable. You can't kick the ball over the walls or around them. The ball is kicked straight at the infinite walls. We've stumbled on a deep conceptual problem with no clear path to resolution.

Fortunately, philosophers have developed a lot of conceptual tools for thinking about paradoxes. Many of these tools are incredibly formal, like mathematical logic. In fact, many colloquial paradoxes (like the barber paradox and the liar paradox) are just natural language restatements of formal mathematical paradoxes (like Russell's paradox and the liar sentence). Here, I'll give a less formal framework designed for those without a significant background in philosophy that comes from R.M. Sainsbury's wonderful book *Paradoxes*.
