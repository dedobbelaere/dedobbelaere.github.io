## Mission Statement

Like many listless college educated 20-somethings, I have decided to start maintaining a blog on my personal site. I'll be trying to maintain a consistent upload schedule, but I have seen that promise written on many blogs that haven't been updated since 2016. Don't get your hopes up.

This will be my main forum for posting my non-philosophy work, which may include essays, half-formed opinions, and book reviews. Once I start publishing philosophical articles, the best place to find them will be my [philpapers](https://philpeople.org/profiles/adam-dedobbelaere) page.

I'd like to apologize in advance for any psychic damage that reading my unreviewed thoughts and opinions may cause. Thanks for reading anyways.
