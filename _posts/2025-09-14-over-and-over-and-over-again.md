Both politically and intellectually I am diametrically opposed to the ideology and methods of organizations like Turning Point USA. Their particular brand of illiberal Christian nationalism is, I think, backwards. The style of debate that is employed by the new right seems to me better designed to produce "gotcha" moments and viral clips than to allow for dispassionate deliberation with the goal of producing knowledge. As one of my friends aptly put it on the day of Charlie Kirk's murder, he "just trolls college students." If I were a hardcore consequentialist (which I'm not), I might be more inclined to feel good about Kirk's death. Watching the video of Kirk's death, it is hard to believe there is anything to feel good about. Kirk puts the microphone down after answering a question, there is a pop, visible impact, his arms contract and his head is thrown back, and blood starts pouring out of his neck.

I have seen political violence in the flesh. When I was protesting in Madison in 2020, some of my fellow protestors lit dumpsters on fire and pushed them into the courthouse off capitol square. Shortly after, police shot tear gas at us as we marched down East Washington. Reflecting on these scenes in recent years, I have struggled to figure out what precisely it was all in service of. Part of this is the general confusion of that year, the great surge of emotion and activism that swept through the country in the middle of a pandemic. I don't know what I expected to accomplish by joining those protests. I wasn't committed to abolishing the police, and I'm not sure any other of the tenets of that movement ran more than skin deep for me.

There's a gap between what I experienced in Madison and Kirk's death to be sure. I was a small part of a mass movement of people, moved by a singular act of violence to show their disaffection with the current system. Kirk's death was the act of a single person, acting under nebulous goals and values. The scale is incomparable. What unites the two events in my mind is the utter hopelessness for politics in this country that I experience on reflection of each. I don't think this sentiment is unique to the United States, either. Talking with friends of mine from Taiwan and Turkey, they seem to share a common feeling of hopelessness, their political environments are similarly fractured and disparate.

Much ink has been spilled about what to do about the situation we find ourselves in, our inability to talk to each other, increasing polarization, etc. I see lots of empty platitudes, love thy neighbor, whatever. Those of you who are familiar with my writing on this blog should be well-acquainted with my pessimism by now. Rather than spiral I'll do my best to find the root of it.

Let me, then, ask myself: "What exactly do *I* think is needed to lower the political temperature?" If I'm being really honest, my answer is that other people need to change their beliefs. Nothing specific, I don't need people to agree with me on the top tax rate the country should have, but I do expect some agreement on the fundamentals of what government is and what it is for. Background ideals, like government as a system of fair cooperation, uncoercive, designed for the benefit of the governed and not those governing. 

I realize these might sound like the same platitudes I cast aside not one paragraph earlier, but these ideals go farther in their prescriptive force for government. I don't know how I would write a constitution based on the command "love thy neighbor." There's nothing about loving one's neighbor (which is, I should add, a good thing) that tells us what government should look like or how it should be restricted or empowered. If we understand government as a system of fair cooperation, there is a bit more direction.

These are not ideals that run skin deep in people. If you are a committed Christian nationalist or tankie, you're not going to be easily persuaded to embrace a pluralist vision of government that makes room for a wide variety of different conceptions of a good life. Dispassionate, reasonable discourse is extremely difficult to maintain when these kind of convictions are put to the test. Egos are threatened, people are concerned with defending their own honor or moral status, and any epistemic humility, any hint of an idea that my ideology might be flawed or in need of amendment is subordinated to the goal of winning (or simply not losing) an argument.

Despite all my pessimism I think that the reasoned debate we so desperately need to start engaging in is possible. I spend much of my time locked inside the ivory tower but in the times I step out I find people who are willing to engage, to some meaningful extent, in good faith debate about what sort of government we should create. Real, societal change will take time, but it is at the very least possible. I won't tell you to go out and find someone you disagree with and try to understand them, I'd be treading dangerously close to platitude territory. But I do think it's worth anyone's time to keep an eye out for substantive conversation, wherever it might be found.

If there is anyone who is unpersuaded by what I have written here, who still believes that the best method of engaging in politics is either helicopter rides or gallows, I recommend you watch the Charlie Kirk video. Really get a sense for what political violence *feels* like in the real world. There are no heroic angles of this killing. There's no righteousness, no glory, nothing that sparks hope or inspires virtue. There's a young man spewing blood from his neck while thousands of kids watch. We can talk with each other, or watch it over, and over, and over again.
