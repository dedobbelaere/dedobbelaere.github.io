title: About Me
---

I was born in Chicago, Illinois and raised in the suburbs. I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I majored in philosophy and graduated with Comprehensive Honors (both Honors in the Major and Honors in the Liberal Arts). I wrote my undergraduate thesis on Spinoza's modal metaphysics in the *Ethics* under the supervision of [James Messina](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/james-messina).

After undergrad I worked at Epic Systems in Verona, Wisconsin for two years. I was a project manager on the population health team, where most of my projects were related to value-based care programs and Medicare Advantage contracts. During this time I also served as an ethics consultant for the artificial intelligence and machine learning team. Working as an ethics consultant reminded me how much I missed philosophy, so I left Epic and applied to graduate school. I was lucky to be accepted to the University of Rochester, where I am now a student. My adviser is [Paul Audi](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/phl/people/faculty/audi_paul/index.html). In bioethics, I work with [Jonathan Herington](https://jherington.com/index.php) on algorithmic fairness.

Outside of philosophy you can find me reading (especially experimental fiction), playing chess, or working at a local pizza joint.
